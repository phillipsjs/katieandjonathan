# Some important info:

## Weather and clothing 

It looks like we will have sunny weather, and it may be a bit warmer (high 80s) during the day and then cooler (high 60s) toward the later part of the evening. The entire event will be held outdoors and the wedding ceremony will be a short hike (\~5 minutes) from the ski lodge. We recommend wearing shoes you can comfortably walk slightly uphill in and feel free to bring an extra layer for later in the evening!
