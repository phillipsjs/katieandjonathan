# Questions and Answers:

## Is this wedding kid friendly? 
All children are welcome to join for all events associated with our wedding weekend. Dinner on Saturday night will be pizza, which should accommodate even the pickiest of eaters. Make sure the kiddos bring their dancing shoes! Alternatively, if you would like some suggestions for child care, please contact the bride for some local recommendations. 

## What should I wear? 
Prepare for an outdoor wedding! Flats, wedges, or block heels are recommended for Saturday and both events call for semi-formal or casual wedding attire. There will be a short hike (\~5 minutes) up to the ceremony location. It looks like we will have sunny weather, and it may be a bit warmer (80s) during the day and then cooler (60s) toward the later part of the evening.

## You didn’t ask about dietary restrictions on the RSVP form. 
The entire weekend will be non-strict vegetarian - meaning that cheeses may have animal rennet or other byproducts, but we will not be serving any dishes containing meat. Vegan and gluten-free options will be provided for dinner on Saturday and there will be vegan desserts on Friday and Saturday. Please note that dinner is cooked on Saturday night out of a food truck and there is a high likelihood of cross-contamination with wheat flour and potentially dairy products. If you follow a strict diet that doesn’t allow for that, please contact the bride or groom.  

## What will transportation to the venue on Saturday look like? 
We will be providing transportation on school buses to and from Whaleback. There will be pickup/drop off locations from Hanover, White River Junction, the Courtyard Marriot, and the Shaker Museum. You can find out more info about the buses on the <a href="https://katieandjonathan.wedding/dayof.html">"Day-of Info</a>" page.

## Can I drive myself? 
Yes. There is plenty of parking at Whaleback, and if you decide to leave a car overnight we can help coordinate carpools to pick up a car on Sunday morning. Please do not drive impared. 

## COVID-19
Most guests will be vaccinated by August, but we are not requiring or checking the vaccination status of guests. We encourage guests who are not feeling 100% to take a rapid test before arriving. Rapid test kits are readily available at several pharmacies in the area. The entire event will be outdoors, so it should be relatively safe.
