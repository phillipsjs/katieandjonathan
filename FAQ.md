# Questions and Answers:

## Is this wedding kid friendly? 
All children are welcome to join for all events associated with our wedding weekend. Dinner on Saturday night will be pizza, which should accommodate even the pickiest of eaters. Make sure the kiddos bring their dancing shoes! Alternatively, if you would like some suggestions for child care, please contact the bride for some local recommendations. 

## What should I wear? 
Prepare for an outdoor wedding! Flats, wedges, or block heels are recommended for Saturday and both events call for semi-formal or casual wedding attire. We’ll send out an email update about planning for inclement weather closer to the date, but for now try not to lose any umbrellas before August 20th! 

## Speaking of weather…
We’re planning a primarily outdoor event with not a lot of contingencies for inclement weather. Keep your fingers crossed for us! In August the days can be anywhere from 70 to 100 degrees, but the evenings are usually quite cool. We recommend bringing either a rain jacket or shawl to keep warm after the sun goes down. 

## You didn’t ask about dietary restrictions on the RSVP form. 
The entire weekend will be non-strict vegetarian - meaning that cheeses may have animal rennet or other byproducts, but we will not be serving any dishes containing meat. Vegan and gluten-free options will be provided for dinner on Saturday and there will be vegan desserts on Friday and Saturday. Please note that dinner is cooked on Saturday night out of a food truck and there is a high likelihood of cross-contamination with wheat flour and potentially dairy products. If you follow a strict diet that doesn’t allow for that, please contact the bride or groom.  

## What will transportation to the venue on Saturday look like? 
Please stay tuned to the website for updates on bus transportation. We will be providing transportation to and from Whaleback. There will be pickup/drop off locations  in Hanover and White River Junction, and one or two other locations depending on where guests are staying. Please answer the lodging question in the RSVP form so we can add bus stops! 

## Can I drive myself? 
Yes. There is plenty of parking at Whaleback, and if you decide to leave a car overnight we can help coordinate carpools to pick up a car on Sunday morning. Please do not drive impared. 

## COVID-19
Most guests will be vaccinated by August, but we are not requiring or checking the vaccination status of guests. If there is an outbreak around late August we will send a reminder for everyone to take a rapid test before attending any events. Rapid test kits are readily available at several pharmacies in the area. If the weather cooperates all events will be primarily outside.
