# Some suggestions

Bring your adventure spirit because the Upper Valley is a terrific region for hiking, mountain biking, and water recreation.

## Hikes: 
1. <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/new-hampshire/velvet-rocks-via-appalachian-trail">Velvet Rocks</a> - a fun, 3ish mile hike along the Appalachian Trail right in Hanover. There is a trail that connects to Wheelock St. to make it a loop back into town. Perfect to combine with a breakfast at Lou’s or lunch at The Nest Kitchen. 
2.  <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/vermont/gile-mountain-trail">Gile Mountain</a> - a short but steep hike in Norwich with a great view from the fire tower at the top. If you’re looking for a longer, gentler trail more suitable for running, the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/vermont/gile-mountain-via-blue-ribbon-trail">Blue Ribbon</a> trail from the other side is one of our favorite running trails in the area (10mi rt). 
3. Pine Park & Occam Pond - The trails around Pine Park are lovely, gentle walking trails that wind through what used to be the Hanover Country Club. There are great views of the Connecticut river and many spots along the water to stop for a picnic. Lots of parking is available near the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8tf75GcomG4GLYTN9">Dartmouth Outing Club</a> and the road around Occam Pond is a classic Dartmouth stroll. 

## Mountain Biking:
I’m going to be honest here, we’re not big mountain bikers. We recommend stopping over at Omer & Bob’s in Lebanon to rent bikes and inquire about fun trails. There is a great, flat rail trail that starts just near the shop and continues East for many miles. 

## Water sports:
Kayaking and canoeing on the Connecticut river is very fun on a hot day! You can rent from the <a href="http://www.ledyardcanoeclub.org/rentals-and-memberships.html">Ledyard Canoe Club</a> for paddling on the Connecticut river or from <a href="https://www.storrspond.org/activities/canoeing/">Storrs Pond</a> for a gentler, kid friendly option that is also great for swimming. 

## Indoor Options:
1. The <a href="https://www.montshire.org/">Montshire Museum of Science</a> is a great little science museum designed mostly for kids, but is fun for all. 
2. The <a href="https://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/">Hood Museum</a> is Dartmouth’s art museum. Among the museum's most important holdings are six Assyrian stone reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II (about 900 BCE).
3. The <a href="https://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/explore/exhibitions/orozcos-epic-american-civilization">Epic of American Civilization (1932–34)</a> is a remarkable large-scale fresco painted by José Clemente Orozco and is registered as a National Historic Landmark. Located in the basement of Dartmouth’s Baker Library building, it is definitely worth a special trip and has become one of our favorite art pieces.

1. For a nicer meal, our favorite spot is <a href="https://www.simonpearce.com/our-restaurant">Simon Pearce</a>> in Quechee, VT. The food is wonderful and the views from the Mill are spectacular. Arrive early and browse the glass shop. Reservations required, **$$$**
