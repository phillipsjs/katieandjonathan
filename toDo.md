# Things to do

Bring your adventure spirit because the Upper Valley is a terrific region for hiking, mountain biking, and water recreation. 

## Hikes: 

1. <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/new-hampshire/velvet-rocks-via-appalachian-trail">Velvet Rocks</a> - a fun, 3ish mile hike along the Appalachian Trail right in Hanover. There is a trail that connects to Wheelock St. to make it a loop back into town. Perfect to combine with a breakfast at Lou’s or lunch at The Nest Kitchen. 
2.  <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/vermont/gile-mountain-trail">Gile Mountain</a> - a short but steep hike in Norwich with a great view from the fire tower at the top. If you’re looking for a longer, gentler trail more suitable for running, the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/vermont/gile-mountain-via-blue-ribbon-trail">Blue Ribbon</a> trail from the other side is one of our favorite running trails in the area (10mi rt). 
3. Pine Park & Occam Pond - The trails around Pine Park are lovely, gentle walking trails that wind through what used to be the Hanover Country Club. There are great views of the Connecticut river and many spots along the water to stop for a picnic. Lots of parking is available near the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8tf75GcomG4GLYTN9">Dartmouth Outing Club</a> and the road around Occam Pond is a classic Dartmouth stroll.
