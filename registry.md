# Registry

The very best present we can receive is your presence at our wedding and your love and support as we embark on this adventure together.
 
We recognize that especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding will already entail spending money on travel and hotel accommodations.
 
Many of you are contributing your time and energy to this event, and for the gift of your participation we thank you.
 
Homemade, handmade, and second hand gifts are welcomed and appreciated.

To make it easier for the more traditional gift givers among you, we have listed a few organizations that will appreciate a donation of any amount. 


**<a href="https://kilhambearcenter.org/">The Kilham Bear Center</a>** in Lyme, NH rescues, rehabilitates, and releases orphaned, abandoned, and injured black bear cubs back into the wild. In the spring of 2021, the Center released 40 yearling bears back to the wild. In the spring of 2022, the Center has 18 yearlings for release. Currently, they have 3 new orphan cubs of the year and expect to receive more. Your donation will help pay for food, medical supplies and care, and safe, warm enclosures for the bear cubs while they are rehabilitating, growing, and learning to be bears! 

**<a href="https://www.vermontadaptive.org/donate/">Vermont Adaptive</a>** is a nationally recognized organization that empowers people of all abilities through inclusive sports and recreational programming regardless of ability to pay. In addition to sports, year-round programming options integrate environmental, holistic wellness, and competitive training philosophies for people of all ages with cognitive, developmental, physical and emotional disabilities. Katie volunteers with Vermont Adaptive in the winters to coach adaptive skiing!

**Abortion Care**: People will die because of the Dobbs V Jackson Women’s Health Organization SCOTUS decision on June 24, 2022. Here is a list of several organizations that we recommend supporting. Please try to give to a local organization.  There are extraordinary folks who have been setting up the infrastructure, preparing for this, and doing this work non-stop. Now is not the time to support Planned Parenthood, NARAL, The ACLU, or The Center for Reproductive Rights. These organizations have long-standing foundation funding, they have major grants, and access to donors that small abortion funds, independent clinics, and many state-based orgs DO NOT. 58% of abortions are performed by independent providers (<a href="https://abortioncarenetwork.org/cnc2020/">https://abortioncarenetwork.org/cnc2020/</a>). We are supporting local and independent abortion care providers in New Hampshire and nationally, including: 

* Here’s an ActBlue <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/fundabortionnow">link</a> that will split funds between 80 abortion funds
* Support <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bffforaccess">Black feminist leadership</a> fighting for Reproductive Justice
* Support local, independent abortion clinics via the <a href="https://keepourclinics.org/donate/">Keep Our Clinics</a> campaign and the <a href="https://abortioncarenetwork.org/">Abortion Care Network</a>
* Give to state-based orgs led by Black, Brown, and Indigenous folks. These leaders have been investing in this long-term fight, and will continue to be leading for years to come:
* * <a href="https://www.reprofundnh.com/">The Reproductive Freedom Fund of New Hampshire</a> - NH
* * <a href="https://www.hollerhealthjustice.org/">Holler Health Justice</a> - Appalachia
* * <a href="https://avowtexas.org/">AVOW Texas</a> - TX
* * <a href="https://janesdueprocess.org/">Jane’s Due Process</a> - TX
* * <a href="https://www.lilithfund.org/">The Lilith Fund</a> - TX
* * <a href="https://newvoicesrj.org/">New Voices for Reproductive Justice</a> - OH and PA
